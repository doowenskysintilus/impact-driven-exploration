# RIDE: Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration for Procedurally-Generated Environments

This is an implementation of the method proposed in 

<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rkg-TJBFPB">RIDE: Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration for Procedurally-Generated Environments</a> 

by Roberta Raileanu and Tim Rockt√§schel, published at ICLR 2020. 

We propose a novel type of intrinsic reward which encourges the agent to take actions that result in significant changes to its representation of the environment state.

The code includes all the baselines and ablations used in the paper. 

The code was also used to run the baselines in [Learning with AMIGO:
Adversarially Motivated Intrinsic Goals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12122.pdf). 
See [the associated repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/adversarially-motivated-intrinsic-goals) for instructions on how to reproduce the results from that paper.

## Installation

```
# create a new conda environment
conda create -n ride python=3.7
conda activate ride 

# install dependencies
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/impact-driven-exploration.git
cd impact-driven-exploration
pip install -r requirements.txt

# install MiniGrid
cd gym-minigrid
python setup.py install
```

## Train RIDE on MiniGrid
```
cd impact-driven-exploration

OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 python main.py --model ride --env MiniGrid-ObstructedMaze-2Dlh-v0 

OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 python main.py --model ride --env MiniGrid-KeyCorridorS3R3-v0 \
--intrinsic_reward_coef 0.1 --entropy_cost 0.0005
```
